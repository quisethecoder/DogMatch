DogMatch is a website for owners to meet with dogs nearby.



Tools Used
The main tools used to make Tindog are HTML, Bootstrap for spacing and alignment, and also to make the website mobile friendly.CSS was used for design, and GSAP for animation in the beginning when you first open the page. I also practiced UI desgin in making this website.
